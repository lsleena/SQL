Returning Query Results in a Specified Order :

select ename,job,sal from emp where deptno = 10 order by sal asc;

select ename,job,sal from emp where deptno = 10 order by sal desc;


No need to specify column name, can add column number instead:

select ename,job,sal	  from emp	 where deptno = 10	 order by 3 desc;


Sorting by Multiple Fields:

 select empno,deptno,sal,ename,job from emp order by deptno, sal desc
  

The order of precedence in ORDER BY is from left to right.
You are generally permitted to order by a column not in the SELECT list, but to do so you must explicitly name the column. 
However, if you are using GROUP BY or DISTINCT in your query, you cannot order by columns that are not in the SELECT list.

Sorting by Substring:

	select ename, job from emp
   order by substr(job,length(job)-1);


Dealing with Nulls when Sorting :

 select ename, sal, comm   from ( select ename, sal, comm, 
case when comm is null then 0 else 1 end as is_null   from emp ) x
 order by is_null desc, comm



select ename,sal,comm,
	       case when comm is null then 0 else 1 end as is_null
from emp

You want to sort based on some conditional logic. For example: if JOB is “SALESMAN” you want to sort on COMM; otherwise, you want to sort by SAL. You want to return the following result set:
 
select ename,sal,job,comm
	  from emp
 order by case when job = 'SALESMAN' then comm else sal end
