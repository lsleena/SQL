Returning Query Results in a Specified Order :

select ename,job,sal from emp where deptno = 10 order by sal asc;

select ename,job,sal from emp where deptno = 10 order by sal desc;


No need to specify column name, can add column number instead:

select ename,job,sal	  from emp	 where deptno = 10	 order by 3 desc;


Sorting by Multiple Fields:

 select empno,deptno,sal,ename,job from emp order by deptno, sal desc
  

The order of precedence in ORDER BY is from left to right.
You are generally permitted to order by a column not in the SELECT list, but to do so you must explicitly name the column. 
However, if you are using GROUP BY or DISTINCT in your query, you cannot order by columns that are not in the SELECT list.
